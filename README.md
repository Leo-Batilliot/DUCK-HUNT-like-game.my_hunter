# MY_HUNTER
Welcome to my first graphical programming project.  
This project is a pokemon themed remake of Duck Hunt(a nintendo NES game) using csfml.  
use make and ./my_hunter to play (use ./my_hunter -h for more informations)  
please use it in a graphical environnement and with the correct assets, the error handling is minimal.
